# Tidying your data means storing it in a consistent form that matches the semantics 
# of the dataset with the way it is stored.
# In brief, when your data is tidy, each column is a variable, and each row is an observation.
# Tidy data is important because the consistent structure lets you focus your struggle 
# on questions about the data, not fighting to get the data into the right form for
# different functions.

# Together with Import and Transform, it is part of data wrangling.
