# Models are complementary tools to visualization. Once you have made your
# questions sufficiently precise, you can use a model to answer them. Models
# a fundamentally mathematical or computational tool, so they generally scale well.
# Even when they don't, it's usually cheaper to buy more computers than it is
# to buy more brains! But every model makes assumptions, and by its very nature
# a model cannot question its own assumptions. That means a model cannot
# fundamentally surprise you!
