# atools

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of atools is to make my life easier. That includes, but is not limited to, easing the access and maintenance of convenience functions, making projects and reports in standardized form, optimization and improved house-keeping of future endeavours.

## Installation

You can install the development version of atools from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sokolicA/atools")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(atools)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
